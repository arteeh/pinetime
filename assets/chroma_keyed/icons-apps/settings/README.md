## How the settings-brightness-* icons work

To save space, I've removed duplicate content from each of these images. When you draw the brightness setting screen, you should draw the icons in the following locations:

- settings-brightness-low at X  70 and Y  20
- settings-brightness-mid at X 107 and Y 107
- settings-brightness-high at X 20 and Y 43

When to draw:

- At low brightness, draw low only.
- At mid brightness, draw low and mid.
- At high brightness, draw low, mid and high.
