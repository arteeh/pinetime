## Assets

The `icons-apps` folder contains icons for common applications, with both svg's and LVGL-style bitmaps as C files.

The `icons-os` folder contains symbols for use in the standard UI, like a bluetooth icon.

`gnome-stencils.svg` is taken from the Adwaita theme. More symbols can be extracted from here.
